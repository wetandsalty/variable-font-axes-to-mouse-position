# variable-font-axes-to-mouse-position
Want to show off your variable font in an interactive way? This maps two axes of a variable font to the X and Y position of the mouse cursor, using jquery and the font-variation-settings CSS property. 

You can see an example of it in use <a href="http://luniadambrosio.de/cantina-variable-font/">here</a>; with my friend Lunia D'Ambrosio's variable font <i>Cantina</i> which is inspired by old italian typefaces from the 1950s.
